Last updated: November 23, 2025
Developer: Blue Lattice Software

1. Introduction

ORYN Chronoguard is a parental-control and device-management app designed to help parents limit distracting apps on a child’s device.
We take privacy seriously. Our goal is simple:

We only collect what is absolutely necessary, and we never sell or share your data.

This Privacy Policy explains what information ORYN Chronoguard collects, how it is used, and how it is protected.

2. Information We Collect

We collect minimal data, only what is required for the app to function securely.

2.1. Parent PIN (Local Only)

The parent PIN is stored only on the child’s device using Android’s encrypted storage.

It is never uploaded, shared, or transmitted to any server.

We cannot access it.

2.2. Recovery Email (Optional)

If you provide a recovery email, it is used only to send PIN-reset verification codes.

We store:

Your email address

A timestamp

A hashed verification code (never the plain code)

This information is stored securely in Google Firebase.

2.3. Offline Recovery Code

A one-time offline code is generated locally.

It is stored only on the device and never transmitted.

We cannot access or recover it.

2.4. App Usage Information (Local Only)

To enforce time limits and blocks, ORYN Chronoguard detects which app is currently on screen.

We do NOT collect or read:

Messages

Photos

Videos

Browsing history

Keystrokes

In-app content

ORYN Chronoguard only checks the package name of the foreground app and nothing else.

2.5. Firebase

We use Google Firebase for:

PIN recovery

Email verification

Error diagnostics (non-personal)

Firebase automatically collects:

Device model

Basic crash logs

Android version

We do not use Firebase Analytics.

2.6. Ads (Google AdMob)

ORYN Chronoguard displays ads on:

The lock screen

After device unlock (rewarded / interstitial)

AdMob may collect:

Advertising ID

Approximate location (country-level)

Device/interaction metadata

This is standard for all Google-served ads.

ORYN Chronoguard does not use:

Personalized ads for children

Targeted behavior profiles

Sensitive category targeting

Parents can disable Ad Personalization via Google settings.

3. How We Use Your Information

We use your data only to:

Unlock the device (local PIN)

Send recovery emails (Firebase + SendGrid)

Prevent bypassing time limits (app detection)

Serve ads to support the free version

We never:

Sell your data

Share your data with third parties outside Firebase/SendGrid/AdMob

Monitor personal content

4. Children’s Privacy

ORYN Chronoguard is a parent tool installed on a child’s device.

We comply with:

Google Play Families Policy

COPPA

GDPR-K

General data-minimization best practices

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

The only personal data collected is:

Parent’s recovery email (optional)

No child-specific data is collected.
